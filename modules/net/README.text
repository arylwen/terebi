This is the network (telnet) component of Terebi.

- The design is inspired by the Jetty project, however all code is original.
- Some terminology was taken from the telnetd project from sourceforge

- Depedencies are managed with Ivy (http://ant.apache.org/ivy)
  The build file will automatically install ivy into ${HOME}/.ant/ if you don't already have it
